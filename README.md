# scheme-to-c
A project I did that takes code written in Racket (or Scheme) and translates it into to a crazy, hard-to-read C file. The Scheme code which I used is a simple factorial function.

The .c file included is the result of the translation. While it isn't pretty and has a lot of warnings when ran, it does exactly what the Racket or Scheme code I used. In this case, it returns 5!. 

a9.rkt is where most of the code is.
